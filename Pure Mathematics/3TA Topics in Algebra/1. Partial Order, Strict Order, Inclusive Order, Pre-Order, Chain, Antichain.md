# Def: Partial order

A partial order on a [[Definition - Set|set]] $P$ is a [[Definition - Binary Relation|binary relation]] "$\leq$" on $P$ such that, $\forall~x,y,z\in P$, 

1. (Reflexive) $x\leq x$
2. (Antisymmetric) $x\leq y,~y\leq x~\Rightarrow~x=y$ 
3. (Transitive) $x\leq y,~y\leq z~\Rightarrow~x\leq z$

We say $x||y$ is $x$ and $y$ are incomparable.

A set $P$ coupled with a partial order $\leq$, is denoted $(P,\leq)$ and is called a partially ordered set ("poset").

# Def: Strict Order
$x<y~\equiv~x\leq y~\cap~x\neq y$

# Def: Inclusive Order
An **inclusive** order or **order by inclusion** is an order put on the [[Definition - Power Set|power set]] of a set. So, letting $X$ be a [[Definition - Set|set]] and $P(X)$ the [[Definition - Power Set|power set]] of $X$, define $$\forall A,B\subseteq X,~~~A\leq B~\Leftrightarrow~B\leq A$$ (Check that this is indeed an order)

# Def: Pre-Order

A pre-order is a partial order but without the antisymmetric axiom.

OR

A pre-order ("order") on a [[Definition - Set|set]] $P$ is a [[Definition - Binary Relation|binary relation]] "$\leq$" on $P$ such that, $\forall~x,y,z\in P$, 

1. (Reflexive) $x\leq x$
2. (Transitive) $x\leq y,~y\leq z~\Rightarrow~x\leq z$
