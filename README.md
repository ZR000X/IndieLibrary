Feel free to fork the entire knowledge base to play around with it or check out the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JTghgKmc7U) (Indie Academy Discord Server, or IADS) to join our fearless band of intellectual warriors facing the perils of STEM fields, together :').

The Discord Bot, [Indie Bot](https://github.com/cxr00/IndieBot) is also in the works. It's job is to facilitate the happenings on IADS, allowing for neat interactable features and specifically some automated management of Indie Library (many features not yet developed).
