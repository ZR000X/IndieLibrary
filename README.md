# Indie Library
Thank you for stopping by and taking a look at our Open Education project of collaborative markdown notes.

## Installation
1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), then clone this project using it.
2. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), then open the local directory as a "vault" using it.

Feel free to fork the entire knowledge base to play around with it. Also, why not join the [Indie Academy Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JTghgKmc7U) to study and converse with our fearless band of intellectual warriors facing the perils of STEM fields.

The Discord Bot, [Indie Bot](https://github.com/cxr00/IndieBot), is also being developed. It's job is to facilitate the happenings on IADS, allowing for neat interactable features and specifically some automated management of Indie Library (many features not yet developed).
