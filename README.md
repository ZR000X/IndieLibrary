# Indie Library
Thank you for stopping by and taking a look at our Open Education project of collaborative markdown notes. 

Currently, most of the library is written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), so you'll need to install it to view that part of the library at best quality. We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) as well to get the project onto your computer.

Feel free to fork the entire knowledge base to play around with it or check out the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JTghgKmc7U) (Indie Academy Discord Server, or IADS) to join our fearless band of intellectual warriors facing the perils of STEM fields, together :').

The Discord Bot, [Indie Bot](https://github.com/cxr00/IndieBot) is also in the works. It's job is to facilitate the happenings on IADS, allowing for neat interactable features and specifically some automated management of Indie Library (many features not yet developed).
