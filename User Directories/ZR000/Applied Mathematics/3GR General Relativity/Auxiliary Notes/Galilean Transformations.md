The Galilean transformations are
$$x'=x-vt$$
$$y'=y$$
$$z'=z$$
$$t'=t$$

So the Galilean transformations describe a reference frame $\mathcal{O}'(x',y',z',t')$ which is travelling at speed $v$ in the $x$-direction if observed by reference frame $\mathcal{O}(x,y,z,t)$. 

Since this is constant speed, there is no acceleration present between $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{O}'$ are inertial references frames as long as one of them is. There are also an infinite set of intertial reference frames, all travelling at constant speed with respect to one another.

Under these transformations, the velocities transform as
$$v_x'=x_v-v$$
$$v_y'=v_y$$
$$v_z'=v_z$$
and more generally, we have
$$\vec{X}'=R(\theta,\phi)\vec{X}-\vec{v}t-\vec{d}$$
where $R$ is the rotation matrix that aligns $\mathcal{O}'$ and $\mathcal{O}$, $\vec{v}$ is the relative velocity of $\mathcal{O}'$ with respect to $\mathcal{O}$, and $\vec{d}$ is the displacement of the origin from $\mathcal{O}$.

Note that [[Newton's Laws|Newton's laws]] are invariant under these types of transformations, since
$$\vec{a}'=\frac{d\vec{v}'}{dt}=\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}=\vec{a}$$
