Newton stated three laws:

* Free particles are not accelerated, i.e., they move with constant velocity.
* The force vector $\vec{F}$ is proportional to the rate of change of momentum, by the equation $$\vec{F}=\frac{d}{dt}(m\vec{v})$$
* To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (usually described by the net force on a non-accelerating system as being zero)

Under [[Galilean Transformations|Galilean transformations]], Newton's laws are invariant, as not acceleration is present.
