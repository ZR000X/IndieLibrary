# Def: General PDE
Take any polynomial $\mathcal{L}(p,q)$ with constant coefficients. Consider the equation
$$\mathcal{L}(p,q)u(x,t)=0$$

Now, replace $p\to \partial_t$, $q\to\partial_x$ which mean partial differentiation with respect to $t$ and $x$ respectively. You now have a PDE described by $$\mathcal{L}(\partial_t,\partial_x)u(x,t)=0$$

Some examples:
* [[3MP. Some Differential Equations#Transport Equation|Transport]]: $\mathcal{L}=\partial_t+c\partial_x$
* [[3MP. Some Differential Equations#D'Alembert Wave Equation|D'Alembert]]: $\mathcal{L}=\partial_{tt}-c^2\partial_{xx}$

# Def: Dispersion Relation
By substitution of $u(x,t)=e^{i(\omega t-kx)}$, you obtain an equation which can possibly be solved to produce a set of roots $$\left(\omega_i(k)\right)_{i=1}^n$$ called the **dispersion branches** of the PDE.

# Exercise 3MP.1.1
Find the dispersion relations for all of the equations in [[3MP. Some Differential Equations|here]].
