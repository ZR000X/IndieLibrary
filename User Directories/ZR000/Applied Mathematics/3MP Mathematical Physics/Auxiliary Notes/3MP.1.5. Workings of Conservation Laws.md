# 1

We want to check that
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi|^2=i\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\psi^*\psi_x-\psi_x^*\psi)$$
is true under the Shr&ouml;dinger equation $\psi_t=i\psi_{xx}$. 

We use $|\psi|^2=\psi\psi^*$. Working out the LHS,
$$LHS=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi|^2=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\psi\psi^*)=\psi_t\psi^*+\psi\psi_t^*=i\psi_{xx}\psi^*-i\psi\psi_{xx}^*$$

Working out the RHS, $$RHS=i\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\psi^*\psi_x-\psi_x^*\psi)=i(\psi^*_x\psi_x+\psi^*\psi_{xx}-\psi_{xx}^*\psi-\psi_x^*\psi_x)=i(\psi^*\psi_{xx}-\psi_{xx}^*\psi)$$

Thus LHS=RHS. QED.

For the [[3MP. Some Differential Equations#Shr ouml dinger|Shr&ouml;dinger equation]], we also have the conserved quantity
$$i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\psi^*\psi_x-\psi_x^*\psi)$$

(Check this)
