A unitary operator $\hat{U}$ is an operator whose [[Adjoint|adjoint]] is equal to its inverse, that is,
$$\hat{U}^\dagger=\hat{U}^{-1}~~\Leftrightarrow~~\hat{U}^\dagger\hat{U}=\hat{U}\hat{U}^{\dagger}=\mathbb{1}$$

# Property 1
The product of two unitary operators is again a unitary operator.

PROOF: Let $\hat{U},\hat{V}$ be unitary and let $\hat{W}=\hat{U}\hat{V}$. Observe:
$$\hat{W}\hat{W}^{\dagger}(\hat{U}\hat{V})^\dagger(\hat{U}\hat{V})=\hat{V}^\dagger \hat{U}^\dagger \hat{U}\hat{V}=\mathbb{1}$$

You easily obtain $\hat{W}^{\dagger}\hat{W}=\mathbb{1}$ as well, and hence $\hat{W}$ is unitary. QED.
