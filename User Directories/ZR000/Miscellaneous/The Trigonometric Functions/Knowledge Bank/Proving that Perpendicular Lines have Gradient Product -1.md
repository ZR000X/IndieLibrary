Take two lines of gradient $m_1,m_2$, such that
$$\tan{\theta}=m_1,~~~\tan{\phi}=m_2$$
where the $\tan$ function in this context is defined to be the ratio of $\sin$ and $\cos$.

Notice, by drawing this out, that the angles that each respective line makes at the horizontal, $\theta,\phi$, that for them to be perpendicular we quickly obtain
$$\psi=\theta+\frac{\pi}{2}$$
so therefore
$$m_1m_2=\tan{\theta}\tan{\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}$$ $$m_1m_2=-\tan\theta\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)$$ $$m_1m_2=-\tan\theta\cot\theta=-1$$
where we used [[this]] and [[that]] identity.
