We begin with [[1CL. Limit of a Real Function|the limit]] in relation to real numbers. The limit is a foundational concept that allows to "approach" things and talk about "as we get closer and closer without actually getting there". As you will see, this is an extremely important thing to be able to do, and as mathematicians we need a rigorous formalism with to do this in order to put all of our calculus on solid ground.

After understanding the concept of a limit, we observe the [[KB_Limit Laws|limit laws]] which help us manipulate limits.
