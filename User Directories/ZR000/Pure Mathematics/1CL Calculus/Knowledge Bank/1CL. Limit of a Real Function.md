For arbitrary real function $f:X\to Y$, we say that the limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches $a$, written as
$$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$
is equivalent to the statement
$$\forall \varepsilon>0,~\exists \delta_\varepsilon>0:~~|x-a|<\delta~\Rightarrow~|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$$
which says that for as small as $\varepsilon$ you desire, one can find a value $\delta_\varepsilon$ such that $|x-a|<\delta_\varepsilon$ yields $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$, essentially saying that you can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as you want as long as you make $x$ close enough to $a$.
