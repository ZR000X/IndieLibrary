# When is $|A|\leq|B|$?

It makes intuitive sense to say that if we can map all elements of $A$ to $B$, then its cardinality should be less than or equal to, but only if one-to-one. Thus we use [[1FM. Definition - Cardinality#More generally|the generalised definition of cardinality]].

We know that $|\mathbb{R}|\neq\mathbb{N}$. All we then need is an injection $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ to conclude that $|\mathbb{N}|<|\mathbb{R}|$. This is trivial to find.

**Homework:** Prove that the $\leq$ of cardinalities is transitive.


# How do $|A|,|\mathcal{P}(A)|$ compare?

We now ask the question if we can aribtrarily find bigger and bigger cardinalities ad nauseam. It turns out that we can, with [[1FM.P7. Theorem - Power Set Cardinality is Greater|this theorem]] and [[1FM.P8. Corollary - There are infinitely many cardinal numbers|this corrollary]] showing us a way how.
