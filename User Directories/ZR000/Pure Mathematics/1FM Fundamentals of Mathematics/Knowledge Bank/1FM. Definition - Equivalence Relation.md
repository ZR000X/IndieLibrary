An **equivalence relation** is a [binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") that is [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation "Reflexive relation"), [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation") and [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation").

# Full Definition

That is, a [binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") $\sim$ on a set $X$ is said to be an **equivalence relation**, [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. That is, for all $a,b,c\in X$,

* (Reflexivity) $a\sim a$
* (Symmetry) $a\sim b~~\Leftrightarrow b\sim a$
* (Transitivity) $a\sim b,~b\sim c~\Rightarrow~a\sim c$
