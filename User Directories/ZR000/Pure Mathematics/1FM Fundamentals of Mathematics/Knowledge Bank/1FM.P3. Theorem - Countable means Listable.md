An infinite set $A$ is countable if and only if its elements can be arranged in a list $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n,\ldots$.

PROOF: ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose all of the elements of $A$ can be arranged in a list as indicated. Then one can form the bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\to A$ such that $f(n)=a_n$. Hence, $A$ is countable.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $A$ is countable. If it is finite, the proof is trivial. Suppose it is countably infinite. Then $|A|=|\mathbb{N}|$ by [[1FM. Definition - Countably Infinite etc.|definition]] and the proof follows trivially, similarly to the above.

QED.
