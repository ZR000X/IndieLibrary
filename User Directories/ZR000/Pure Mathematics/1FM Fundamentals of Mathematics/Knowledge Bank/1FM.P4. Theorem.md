If $A$ and $B$ are countably infinite sets, then $A\cup B$ is countably infinite.

**PROOF**: Since $A$ and $B$ are countably infinite, we know that there exists bijections $f_A:A\to\mathbb{N}$ and $f_B:B\to\mathbb{N}$. We now just need to show that there exists a bijection $g:A\cup B\to\mathbb{N}$.
