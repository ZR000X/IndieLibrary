See: [[1FM. Definition - Cardinal Numbers]]]

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $$|A|=|B|=\aleph_0~~\Rightarrow~~|A\times B|=\aleph)$$

**PROOF:** Let $$A=\{a_1,a_2,a_3\ldots\}$$ $$B=\{b_1,b_2,b_3\ldots\}$$

Notice how you can arrange a grid of all $(a_i,b_j)$. This means you can list them all by going along diagonals, hence every element of $A\times B$ can be reached in finite time; that is, there are a finite number of terms before each one if listed that way. Hence, by [[1FM.P3. Theorem - Countable means Listable|this theorem]], the set is countably infinite. QED.
