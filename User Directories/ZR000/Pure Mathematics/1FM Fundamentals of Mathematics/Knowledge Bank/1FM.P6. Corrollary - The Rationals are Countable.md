$$|\mathbb{Q}|=|\mathbb{N}|=\aleph_0$$

**PROOF:** By [[1FM.P5. Theorem - Cross Product of Aleph0 is Aleph0|this theorem]], we can simply find that $$|\mathbb{Q}|=|\mathbb{Z}|\times|\mathbb{N}$$ by observing the definition of $\mathbb{Q}$ in the following form:
$$\mathbb{Q}=\{p/q~:p\in\mathbb{Z},q\in\mathbb{N}\}$$
by noting the bijection between this set and every rational number, even counting those that are deemed equivalent by the rule
$$\forall k,n,m\in\mathbb{Z},~~~\frac{kn}{km}\equiv\frac{n}{m}$$

(Note that we know $|\mathbb{Z}=\aleph_0$).

The result is then achieved the result. QED.

There is also another way of building this result from two tables, similarly to hwo we proved the theorem used.
