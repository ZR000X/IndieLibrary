See: [[1FM.P7. Theorem - Power Set Cardinality is Greater]]

There are infinitely many cardinal numbers, and they are arbitrarily big.

**PROOF:** For arbitrary cardinal number $\aleph=|N_0|$, simply use [[1FM.P7. Theorem - Power Set Cardinality is Greater|the previous theorem]] to find a bigger one:
$$|\mathcal{P}(N_0)|>\aleph$$

Call $N_1=\mathcal{P}(N_0)$ and repeat. QED.
