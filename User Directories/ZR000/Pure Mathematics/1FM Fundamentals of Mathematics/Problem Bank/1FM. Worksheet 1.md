# Q1
1. Show that the function $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,1)$ defined by $f(x)=\frac{x}{x+1}$ is a bijection.
2. Show that the function $h:(0,1)\to(a,b)$ defined by $h(x)=a(1-x)+bx$ is a bijection.
3. Let $\mathbb{Q}_{<0}=\{x\in\mathbb{Q}:x<0\}$. Show that $|\mathbb{Q}_{<0}|=\aleph_0$.

# Q3
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
1. Prove that if $f:A\to B$ is a bijection, then its inverse $f^{-1}:B\to A$ is also a bijection.
2. Prove that $g:A\to B$ being a bijection implies that there is a surjection $h:B\to A$.
# Q4
Let $A,B$ be sets. Prove that $B$ being countable along with $A\subset B$ implies that $A$ is also countable.
# Q5
Let $A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots$ be an infinite list of countable sets, that is, $\forall n,~|A_n|=\aleph_0$. Prove that $$\left|\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_n\right|=\aleph_0$$
