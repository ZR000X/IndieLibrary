# Q2
Let $A,B$ be nonempty sets. Prove:
1. $|A|\leq|A\times B|$
2. $|A\cap B|\leq|A|\leq|A\cup B|$
3. $|A|\leq|B|~\Rightarrow~|\mathcal{P}(A)|\leq|\mathcal{P}(B)|
4. If $|A|<|B|$, then it is impossible for $|B|\leq|A|$.
5. If $B$ is countable and there eists an injection $f:A\to B$, then $A$ must also be countable.
# Q3
Def: A real number is called **algebraic** if it is the root of a polynomail with integer coefficients. A real number that is not algebraic is called **transcendental**, e.g., $\pi$ and $e$. 

Here, let $$\mathbb{F}_n=\{a_nX^n+a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+\ldots+a_0:\forall i, a_i\in\mathbb{Z},a_n\neq0\}$$ be the set of all polynomials of degree $n$ that have integer coefficients.

1. Show that every rational number is algebraic. (Hint: let $p/q$ be your general form for a rational number. We need then to find a polynomial $f(X)$ with integer coefficients such that $f(p/q)=0$)
2. Show that $\sqrt{2}$ is algebraic.
3. Show that, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$, the set $\mathbb{F}_n$ is countable. (Hint: we need to find an injection $\mathbb{F}_n\to \mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$, and use Q2.5)
4. Using Q3.3, show that the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients is countable.
5. Using Q3.4, show that the set $\mathbb{A}$ of all algebraic equations is countable. (Hint: we may use the fact that any polynomial has only finitely many roots)
6. Use Q3.5 to prove that there are uncountably many transcendental numbers.
# Q4
Let $S=\{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_{10}\}$ be a set of any ten natural numbers, all of which must be less than or equal to 100. Define a function $$f:\mathcal{P}(S)\to\mathbb{N},~~~~~f(X)=\sum_{s_i\in X}s_i$$ which is to say that if $X\subset S$ then $f(X)$ is the sum of all the elements in $X$.

Given this, prove that $f$ is not an injection.
