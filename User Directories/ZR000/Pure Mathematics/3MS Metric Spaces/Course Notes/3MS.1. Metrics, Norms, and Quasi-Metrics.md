# Metrics, Norms, Quasi-Metrics, and Balls

We begin by defining [[3MS. Metric and Metric Space|metrics and metric spaces]], and then prove that [[3MS.P1. Proposition - Metrics are Nonnegative|metrics are nonnegative]]. Metrics will be our generalised notion of distance between any two elements of a set, and the content we build will be with respect to an arbitrary distance function that obeys the metric axioms. Different contexts require different distance functions, but all of the theory we develop will only regard metrics in general.

Next, we define [[3MS. Norm and Normed Space|norms and normed spaces]], and show that [[3MS.P2. Proposition - Norms induce Metrics|every norm has at least one associated metric]]. We say that the [[3MS. Norm-Induced Metric|norm induces the metric]].

We end off this section by defining the [[3MS. Quasi-Metric]], which is useful if we seek a "weaker", non-symmetric metric, and then the [[3MS. Open and Closed Balls|open and closed ball]] objects, which will serve as very useful tools in describing other objects as they each contain slightly different notions of "within".
