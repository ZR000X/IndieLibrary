# Convergence in Metric Spaces

We begin this section by defining the [[3MS. Convergence|notion of convergence]] in the general context of metric spaces, prove [[3MS.P3. Proposition - Limits are Unique|this proposition]] which says that the limit of a sequence is unique, and then define [[3MS. Convergence#Coordinatewise Convergence|coordinatewise convergence]].
