The intersection of any family of closed sets, whether there be infinitely many or finitely many sets involved in the intersection, will be again closed.

**PROOF:** Let the sets be $A_1,A_2,\ldots$ and let $B$ be their intersection. Consider any limiting sequence $(b_n)$ in $B$ with a limit $b$. Then $$\forall n,~\exists k:~~b_n\in A_k$$

Hence $(b_n)$ is also a sequence of elements in, say, $A_1$. Therefore, since $A_1$ is closed, $b\in A_1$. Thus $b\in B$, and so $B$ is closed.
