Let $A$ be a subset of some metric space $(X,d)$. Then all of the following hold true:

1. $A\subseteq \bar{A}$
2. $\bar{A}$ is closed.
3. $A$ is closed if and only if $A=\bar{A}$
4. $\bar{\bar{A}}=\bar{A}$

**PROOF**: (1) This is easily shown by considering a constant sequence for each $a\in A$. Each such sequence is obviously a sequence with limit $a$ since it is constant, and hence $a\in A$ implies $a\in\bar{A}$, so $A\subseteq \bar{A}$

(2) Consider an arbitrary sequence $(a_n)\in\bar{A}$ which converges to $a$. Now, for each $a_n$, consider another sequence $(c_{nm})$ such that $c_{nm}\to a_n$.
