* We say that a real sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded from below if there exists a real number $M$ that is less than or equal to every element in the sequence: $x_n\geq M$ for all $n$.
* Similarly for bounded from above.
* We say that a complex sequence $(c_n)$ if bounded if the sequence $(|c_n|)$ is bounded from above.
