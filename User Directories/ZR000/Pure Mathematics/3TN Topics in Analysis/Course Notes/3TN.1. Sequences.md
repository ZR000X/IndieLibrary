We begin by defining a [[3TN. Sequence|sequence]]. Note that we will here be working with sequences of either real or complex values. Also, we often like to study sequences in "large enough depth", or those like $$x:\{n\in\mathbb{N}:n\geq n_0\}\to X$$ for some positive integer $n_0$.

% examples of some sequences go here.

Now we define [[3TN. Bounded Sequence|bounded sequences]]. There are notions of [[3TN. Limit Inferior and Limit Superior|liminf and limsup]], where we make the following notes:
* $\liminf<\limsup$
* $\lim x_n=L~\Leftrightarrow~\limsup (x_n)=\liminf(x_n)$

We then note what [[3TN. Divergent Sequence|divergent sequences mean]], and do a problem interlude.

See [[3TN.P1. Theorem - Algebraic Properties of Limits|this theorem]] on the algebraic properties of limits and the [[3TN.P2. Theorem - Comparison|comparison theorem]] and then more exercises.

We now define [[3TN. Monotone Sequences|increasing and descreasion sequences]] and look at a [[3TN.P3. Proposition 1|proposition]] that monotone sequences only converge if bounded.

# Studying Real Sequences
We will use the following steps when studying a sequence of real numbers
1. Check whether the sequence is well-defined.
2. Check whether the sequence is monotone.
3. Check the boundedness of the sequence.
4. Check if the sequence converges or diverges.
5. If it converges, possibly find its limit.

# Recursive Sequences
We now turn to [[3TN. Recursive Sequences| recursive sequences]]. Examples of such are [[3TN. Arithmetic Sequences|arithmetic]] and [[3TN. Geometric Sequences|geometric]] sequences, yet these two examples are neat in that the elemental formulae can be explicitly stated.

Note that recursive sequences are not always defined. For example, observe $$\begin{matrix}x_0=1\\ x_{n+1}=1-\frac{1}{x_n} & \forall n\in\mathbb{N}\end{matrix}$$
which produces the sequence $\{1,0,u/d,...\}$

This triggers a [[3TN.P4. Proposition 2|proposition]], which to be applied simply requires a suitable choice of the domain of $f$.

# Monotonicity of a recurrent sequence
We start with a [[3TN.P5. Proposition 3|proposition]] and its [[3TN.P6. Corollary 3|corollary]].
