* Increasing sequences are those with $x_{n+1}\geq x_{n}$ for all $n$.
* Decreasing sequences are those with $x_{n+1}\leq x_{n}$ for all $n$.
* We add "strictly" in front if we mean to replace $\leq$,$\geq$ with $<$,$>$ respectively in the above.
* We call these types of sequences **monotone** sequences
