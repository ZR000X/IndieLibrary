A recursive sequence is a sequence $(x_n)$ defined as $$\begin{matrix}
x_0=a\\ 
x_{n+1}=f(x_n) & \forall n\in\mathbb{N}
\end{matrix}$$
where $a$ is some starting number and $f$ is a function.

So, the recursive sequence $(x_n)$ is obtained through iteration of the function. In general, we don't expect to obtain an explicit formula for $x_n(n)$ but in general we won't need to.

We also use the term **recurrent** sequences for recurvsive sequences (for some reason). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_sequence.

Also, we can use short-hand to denote a recursive sequence $(x_n)[a,f]$ to be equivalent to the notation above, since we need only specify the starting point and the iterative function.
