Let $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$, $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be a function and let $x\in X$. If $f(X)\subseteq X$, that is, if the image of $f$ is in $X$, meaning that $X$ is closed under the operation of $f$, then the recursive sequence $(x_n)$ defined by
$$\begin{matrix}
x_0=a\\ 
x_{n+1}=f(x_n) & \forall n\in\mathbb{N}
\end{matrix}$$
is well-defined and $(x_n)\subseteq X$.

PROOF: Trivial.
