Consider the recurrent sequence defined by
$$\begin{matrix}
x_0=a\\ 
x_{n+1}=f(x_n) & \forall n\in\mathbb{N}
\end{matrix}$$
and assume that $f$ is an increasing function. Then
* If $x_0\leq x_1$, then $(x_n)$ is increasing.
* If $x_0\geq x_1$, then $(x_n)$ is decreasing.

PROOF: (By induction) Exercise.
